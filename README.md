Bots are the next hot thing! So in my spare-spare time I've been working on a wrapper for the Telegram API v2.0 for B4J. It has a rather unconventional API but I'm reworking it to make it very easy to write bots in B4J.  Bots could be very useful as yet another way to 'talk' with IoT devices. You can control LEDs, temperatures, ask for stats etc right from within the Telegram Chat App (which runs on about every kind of platform, being the desktop, a browser, iOS, Android, etc...).

Additional Referenced Java Libraries needed (also include jCore.jar):
